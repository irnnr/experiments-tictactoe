# Tic Tac Toe

Just a small exercise in creating a tic-tac-toe game.  

## How to Play

* should work with pretty much any version of Node.js
* `npm i`
* `npm start`
* `^C` to stop

## Features

* prints a board of 3x3 fields after each turn
* keeps track of the current player
* does input validation

## Known Issues (aka Room for Improvement)

* no winner detection
* quitting the game crashes the game instead of gracefully shutting down
* 3x3 field size (would be easy to scale up though)
